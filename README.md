Picklr
======

A Site and Document clipper that strips them of elements and transforms it into something else. Namely this is configured to create more readable websites that can be stored offline with other services, even saving them to other formats like markdown, but also good ole' fashioned HTML. It can also be used to create a clipper service that takes only selected portions of a site or document for digital notebooks or to be placed somewhere else in its reduced form.


Future Ideas
============

- Configurable scraping rules
    - Reducers
      - Site-specific root node to remove all parent nodes
      - Element of type, *i.e* `script`, `head`, `button`, etc.
      - Element of class *i.e* `*button*`, 

- The backend & frontend portion to an Instapaper/Pocket clone that can be configurable
- Interoperability with notebook apps, including my own upcoming project
- Evernote-like clipper in browser or desktop
